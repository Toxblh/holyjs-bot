Meanwhile, a Web page utilizing a couple frameworks looks as lightweight as a hippo. What kind of technology can sync code as well as data? Both code and data may reside in browser's memory, browser-side cache, network cache, CDN, on a prod server, staging server or a developer's own dear laptop. How can we modularize a Web app and deal with components flexibly? How can we version and update them?

This is because rich text editing is inherently hard and features like the HTML attribute contenteditable are broken. Only few companies like Medium provide a solid solution, but they never open sourced it. Draft.js was released earlier this year and is a rich text editing framework that fixes contenteditable and syncs the DOM to a immutable data-structure. This allows you to control the rendering with React components as well as manipulating the content in nice and sane way. In the talk Nik will explain how the data-structure works and show how decorators, block renderers and style-maps can be used to create features like @-mentions, drag & drop images, linkify or hashtags and combine them in one editor.",

You are standing at a fork in the road: Bash or Node? You choose the road less travelled by (for some reason) — Node. Irina congratulates you on this decision. You have written it, you may have published it, and it certainly works. But what now? Is this all a command line module Node is good for: a project clean up and some data manipulation? Along with an audience, Irina is going to take a step further and make a command line module that's more than just your compiling script. Irina, of course, means making it more interactive. In this talk, she wants to take listeners on an adventure that will require cunning, bravery, and maybe some magic. Irina along with attendees will walk through obtaining and parsing data, using Node's process functions, and finally improving the module's user experience.",

        "description": "Nowadays, lots of JavaScript frameworks and UI libraries are focusing on building UI components. With the rise of ES2015 modules and modern build tools, frontend-developers are now able to split their JavaScript codebase into smaller pieces that encapsulate their behavior and logic. And yet many projects are still putting generic class names and selectors into a huge CSS file. The fact is, styles are a part of components and deserve to be treated same way we treat JS. CSS deserves to be scoped and modular and have better tools that improve the developer experience. This talk does a short retrospective of the problems developers have with how they write, organize and bundle CSS and how they can improve it by using a better folder structure, naming conventions and local scope, post-processors like PostCSS and bundlers like webpack. Andrey will tell, how by combining the power of JavaScript and AST, developers can avoid CSS’s bad parts, embrace good ones and even use it to create a better tooling for CSS.",

        "description": "Ensuring bug-free code in JavaScript is challenging, even when devoting considerable resources to testing, and this is partially due to fundamental elements of the JavaScript language design. As an alternative to JavaScript, the Elm language alleviates these issues by incorporating the essence of libraries like React and Redux while adding the advantages of pure functional programming and type inference. This results in code with increased reliability and maintainability, and furthermore yields an improved developer experience. Using own experience from months of building real world components, Tereza will explain why Elm’s design guides you towards well-architectured apps, sharing code and insights, so you can get an impression of the Elm life, while arming you for the gotchas you may encounter in the quest to make your life one too.",
        "aboutSpeaker": "Tereza grew up playing around with the Commodore 64 and IBM’s System. She is learning various currently dead languages, and yet the experience provided her with a solid understanding of programming languages and development. Later Tereza began working in web-development professionally mainly building large scale apps using React and friends. After years of experience, the reoccurring, rather silly, yet aggravating frustrations which come with developing in JavaScript had her looking for alternatives, especially within functional languages. This is where Tereza learned of Elm and since then she has been dedicated to its technical development as well as expanding its community.",

But as developers, and especially JavaScript developers, far too often we are placed in the exclusive context of the tasks we solve at this very moment without paying attention to what happens around us, without thinking about how our work will be used in the end product. The modern developer has to be a craftsman: he has to know how to choose material, handle it and present a product, suitable for this particular user or this particular user group. During this talk Denis will try to set debugger; for yourselves: look around and understand what is going on in the world of our “materials” that we should be using in our work like design, UX, psychology.

The main goal of this talk is to analyze 2 different and at the moment popular buzzwords — serverless and chatbots; combine them with node.js and simple NLP and show how easy is to build useful chatbots with insignificant cost of the infrastructure. Talk will contain following: — Introduction to serverless and AWS Lambda, and explanation why and what it is useful for. — Introduction to chatbots including a short history, an overview of the currently available platforms and a short intro to NLP. — Combining that in a practical example that shows how to develop a chatbot with node.js and simple NLP and how to deploy it to AWS Lambda for a fraction of the cost of a classical server infrastructure and in some cases for $0/month.",

This is because rich text editing is inherently hard and features like the HTML attribute contenteditable are broken. Only few companies like Medium provide a solid solution, but they never open sourced it. Draft.js was released earlier this year and is a rich text editing framework that fixes contenteditable and syncs the DOM to a immutable data-structure. This allows you to control the rendering with React components as well as manipulating the content in nice and sane way. In the talk Nik will explain how the data-structure works and show how decorators, block renderers and style-maps can be used to create features like @-mentions, drag & drop images, linkify or hashtags and combine them in one editor.",

        "description": "Nowadays, lots of JavaScript frameworks and UI libraries are focusing on building UI components. With the rise of ES2015 modules and modern build tools, frontend-developers are now able to split their JavaScript codebase into smaller pieces that encapsulate their behavior and logic. And yet many projects are still putting generic class names and selectors into a huge CSS file. The fact is, styles are a part of components and deserve to be treated same way we treat JS. CSS deserves to be scoped and modular and have better tools that improve the developer experience. This talk does a short retrospective of the problems developers have with how they write, organize and bundle CSS and how they can improve it by using a better folder structure, naming conventions and local scope, post-processors like PostCSS and bundlers like webpack. Andrey will tell, how by combining the power of JavaScript and AST, developers can avoid CSS’s bad parts, embrace good ones and even use it to create a better tooling for CSS.",

        "description": "Ensuring bug-free code in JavaScript is challenging, even when devoting considerable resources to testing, and this is partially due to fundamental elements of the JavaScript language design. As an alternative to JavaScript, the Elm language alleviates these issues by incorporating the essence of libraries like React and Redux while adding the advantages of pure functional programming and type inference. This results in code with increased reliability and maintainability, and furthermore yields an improved developer experience. Using own experience from months of building real world components, Tereza will explain why Elm’s design guides you towards well-architectured apps, sharing code and insights, so you can get an impression of the Elm life, while arming you for the gotchas you may encounter in the quest to make your life one too.",
        "aboutSpeaker": "Tereza grew up playing around with the Commodore 64 and IBM’s System. She is learning various currently dead languages, and yet the experience provided her with a solid understanding of programming languages and development. Later Tereza began working in web-development professionally mainly building large scale apps using React and friends. After years of experience, the reoccurring, rather silly, yet aggravating frustrations which come with developing in JavaScript had her looking for alternatives, especially within functional languages. This is where Tereza learned of Elm and since then she has been dedicated to its technical development as well as expanding its community.",

Why that or another solution does not work or works differently from what we have expected. Every project we deal with as developers will be used by users. But as developers, and especially JavaScript developers, far too often we are placed in the exclusive context of the tasks we solve at this very moment without paying attention to what happens around us, without thinking about how our work will be used in the end product. The modern developer has to be a craftsman: he has to know how to choose material, handle it and present a product, suitable for this particular user or this particular user group. During this talk Denis will try to set debugger; for yourselves: look around and understand what is going on in the world of our “materials” that we should be using in our work like design, UX, psychology.

Currently, promises are the most common way to solve the problem of organizing asynchronous code. Meanwhile, the V8 team announced their plans to natively support async functions. In his talk Eugene will cover the differences between Koa v1, which uses generators, and the next version, which is based on async/await approach. For getting the idea behind Koa, Eugene will dive into the history of JS and try to figure out how language evoulution affects middleware-based web frameworks. Also, in this talk you will see some real Koa use cases, performance benchmarks and discover why async functions are not replacment for generators.",

Ficus.io is a scalable microservice-based application that built on top of Koa web framework. Besides coding, Eugene blogs about JavaScript (vk.com/codehipsters) and participates in development local JS/frontend community.",

      "description": "Rich text editing is super hard. Many developers nowadays don't build rich text experiences and if they do they are very limited. This is because rich text editing is inherently hard and features like the HTML attribute contenteditable are broken. Only few companies like Medium provide a solid solution, but they never open sourced it. Draft.js was released earlier this year and is a rich text editing framework that fixes contenteditable and syncs the DOM to a immutable data-structure. This allows you to control the rendering with React components as well as manipulating the content in nice and sane way. In the talk Nik will explain how the data-structure works and show how decorators, block renderers and style-maps can be used to create features like @-mentions, drag & drop images, linkify or hashtags and combine them in one editor.",

      "description": "Nowadays, lots of JavaScript frameworks and UI libraries are focusing on building UI components. With the rise of ES2015 modules and modern build tools, frontend-developers are now able to split their JavaScript codebase into smaller pieces that encapsulate their behavior and logic. And yet many projects are still putting generic class names and selectors into a huge CSS file. The fact is, styles are a part of components and deserve to be treated same way we treat JS. CSS deserves to be scoped and modular and have better tools that improve the developer experience. This talk does a short retrospective of the problems developers have with how they write, organize and bundle CSS and how they can improve it by using a better folder structure, naming conventions and local scope, post-processors like PostCSS and bundlers like webpack. Andrey will tell, how by combining the power of JavaScript and AST, developers can avoid CSS’s bad parts, embrace good ones and even use it to create a better tooling for CSS.",

      "description": "Ensuring bug-free code in JavaScript is challenging, even when devoting considerable resources to testing, and this is partially due to fundamental elements of the JavaScript language design. As an alternative to JavaScript, the Elm language alleviates these issues by incorporating the essence of libraries like React and Redux while adding the advantages of pure functional programming and type inference. This results in code with increased reliability and maintainability, and furthermore yields an improved developer experience. Using own experience from months of building real world components, Tereza will explain why Elm’s design guides you towards well-architectured apps, sharing code and insights, so you can get an impression of the Elm life, while arming you for the gotchas you may encounter in the quest to make your life one too.",
      "aboutSpeaker": "Tereza grew up playing around with the Commodore 64 and IBM’s System. She is learning various currently dead languages, and yet the experience provided her with a solid understanding of programming languages and development. Later Tereza began working in web-development professionally mainly building large scale apps using React and friends. After years of experience, the reoccurring, rather silly, yet aggravating frustrations which come with developing in JavaScript had her looking for alternatives, especially within functional languages. This is where Tereza learned of Elm and since then she has been dedicated to its technical development as well as expanding its community.",

      "description": "debugger is not just a JavaScript statement. It’s the possibility to have a breakpoint, stop and look around. Look around to understand what is going on. Why that or another solution does not work or works differently from what we have expected. Every project we deal with as developers will be used by users. But as developers, and especially JavaScript developers, far too often we are placed in the exclusive context of the tasks we solve at this very moment without paying attention to what happens around us, without thinking about how our work will be used in the end product. The modern developer has to be a craftsman: he has to know how to choose material, handle it and present a product, suitable for this particular user or this particular user group. During this talk Denis will try to set debugger; for yourselves: look around and understand what is going on in the world of our “materials” that we should be using in our work like design, UX, psychology. Also speaker along with the audience will try to understand why, in addition to everything else, a modern developer has to understand these as well.",
